## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

Everything is pushed to `main` applying [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). Features that are not ready for public are hidden behind feature flags.

### Feature Flags

To view feature-flagged content, add `?featureFlag=true` to the URL:

https://xandrudavid.com/?featureFlag=true

To hide any element behind the feature flag, add the `feature-flag` class:

```html
<section class="feature-flag">
  <!-- Your work-in-progress content -->
</section>
```
